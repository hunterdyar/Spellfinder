# D&D Spellfinder

Teaching myself react to make a view for a simple Rest API: http://www.dnd5eapi.co

Uses react, [mui](https://mui.com/) for layout, [axios](https://axios-http.com/) for http requests, and [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for fuzzy search.

Eventually, I want to copy the API's source data over and access/work with it myself, for the sake of learning different things with React (IE: GraphQL). If that goes well, maybe this could be a proper project, and not just a learning exercise. I likely won't bother publishing if it is *just* a list of standard 5e spells (others exist. Also go buy the books), but it might be fun to, one day, create an online resource for homebrew CC0 spells & items, written by myself or others.
